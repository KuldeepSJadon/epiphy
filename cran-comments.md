## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* elaborated the Description a bit in the DESCRIPTION file.
* added a reference for the methods in the 'Description' field of the DESCRIPTION file.
* removed examples for not yet implemented functionality in Rd files (in clump.Rd and spatial_hier.Rd).

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.5.0
* ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

There was only 1 NOTE (this is a new release):

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Christophe Gigot <ch.gigot@gmail.com>'

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
