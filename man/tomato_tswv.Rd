\description{
Records1: Tomato plants with symptoms of Tomato spotted wilt virus disease. The assessments of
disease incidence were made in 1928, and reported by Bald (1937). Four rectangular plots,
each containing ??? plants (?? rows and ?? columns). Combinations of two cultivars (Burwood Prize and Early Dwarf
Red) and two irrigation systems (overhead sprays and trenches) were studied.
}
\details{
Two varieties were used: Early Dwarf Red and Burwood Prize. There were set in the field on 15th October, 1928.
There were two blocks of each variety. After the seedlings were rooted, there were watered by overhead sprays, or by trenches? Otherwise
all were treated alike. The plants were pruned and staked, and weekly infection records were taken from 6th November to 12th December.

Note that this plot of tomatoes was subjectd to the severest early-season epidemic of spotted wilt recorded at the Waite Intityte, and the severity
of the disease was correlated witht the invasion of thrips in exceptional numbers.

Field plan showing weekly records of infection in four plots of tomatoes.



Regarding the time, here are the meanings:
0 = Healthy plants
Below: diseased plants
1 = 6 November 1928
2 = 14 November 1928
3 = 21 November 1928
4 = 28-29 November 1928
5 = 5 December 1928
6 = 12 December 1928

\section{Records2}{


Intensively mapped disease incidence data reported by Cochran (1936). This virus disease is carried by a species of thrips. Data were obtained from field trislsmade
made at the Waite Institute, Australia. It's an examination by Bald of the spread of this disease.
There were 1440 plants assessed in the field. The tomatoes were planted out in November 26, 1929.
Counts of diseased plants at the first count (December 18), the second count (December 31) and the
last count (January 22) are recorded.
