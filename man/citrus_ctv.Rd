\title{Incidence of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) disease in three fields.}
\format{There are three data sets:
\itemize{
    \item \code{IVI3and4}: A data frame with 864 rows and 5 variables.
    \item \code{IVI6and7}: A data frame with 648 rows and 5 variables.
    \item \code{El_Realengo}: A data frame with 2000 rows and 5 variables.
}

The structure is the same for all the data sets:

\tabular{rll}{
    [, 1:2] \tab x,y \tab Spatial coordinates (in a grid). \cr
    [, 3]   \tab t   \tab Year of disease assessments. \cr
    [, 4]   \tab r   \tab Disease incidence. 0: Healthy, 1: Diseased. \cr
    [, 5]   \tab n   \tab Sampling unit size. n = 1 means that the sampling unit size is the plant. \cr

IVIA6&7 (13). From left to right, mappings represent infections discovered up to May 1990 (60 infections), May 1991 (77 infections), and May 1992 (127
infections), respectively.

Plots IVIA3&4 and IVIA6&7, consisted of 216 trees each of Washington navel orange on Troyer citrange planted in 1978
on a 2 x 6-m spacing. Both plots were located on the grounds of the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones
Agrarias, near Moncada, Valencia, Spain and were assayed yearly from 1981 to 1994.
