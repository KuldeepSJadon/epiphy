\details{
Epidemic of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) observed in eastern Spain (epidemic IVIA3&4 [13]). Black squares denote positions of infections observed at
previous observation times, and white squares represent the new infections recorded in each disease map. From left to right, mappings represent infections dis-
covered up to May 1991 (45 infections), May 1992 (77 infections), and May 1993 (127 infections), respectively.

IVIA6&7 (13). From left to right, mappings represent infections discovered up to May 1990 (60 infections), May 1991 (77 infections), and May 1992 (127
infections), respectively.

Plots IVIA3&4 and IVIA6&7, consisted of 216 trees each of Washington navel orange on Troyer citrange planted in 1978
on a 2 x 6-m spacing. Both plots were located on the grounds of the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones
Agrarias, near Moncada, Valencia, Spain and were assayed yearly from 1981 to 1994.
